I've converted this model to AC3D format, redid the landing gear, cockpit, external stores and textures. Added refueling probe.  The DavePack set of instruments and effects is needed.  This model is now designed to run on FlightGear v1.0 plus the newer JSBSim version which contains "system capability".

Represents an F-100D serving with the 352nd TFS while at Phan Rang Airbase, S.Vietnam.  Thanks to Julien Pierru for the splash screen!
